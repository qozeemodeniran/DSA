Data Structres and Types
DS - storage used to store data and organize data on a computer for efficient update and access.

Types of DS
1. Linear - elements (data) are arranged in sequential order (one after the other). This makes them easy to implement. However, it becomes inefficient when complexity of the program increases.

    * Popular examples of Linear DS
    - Array: elements of same type are arranged in a continuous memory  

    - Stack: elements are arranged on LIFO (last in first out) principle.

    - Queue: elements are arranged on FIFO (first in first out) principle
    
    - Linked List: elements are connected via serieis of node, where each node has data items and address to the next node.

2. Non-Linear - elements (data) are arranged in hierarchical manner, where one element is connected to one or more elements.

    * Types of non-linear DS
    - Graph: each node (vertex) is connected to other vertices via edges.
        ** Popular graph-based DS
        - spanning tree and minimum spanning tree
        - strongly connected components
        - adjacent matrix
        - adjacent list

    - Tree: similar to graph, but only accomadates one edge between vertices
        ** Popular tree-based DS
        - binary tree
        - binary search tree
        - avl tree
        - b- tree
        - b+ tree
        - reb-black tree
